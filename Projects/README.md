## Clone the starter project

You can download or clone this project by running this command from your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/sanusisusi/todo-app
```

This will create a directory in the name of the project folder.

Once you have the project files and folders bootstrapped, open it with your text editor.

Next, switch inside the project directory and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies in the local `node_modules` folder.

Finally, start your development server by running:

```
npm start
```

You should see the app in your browser address bar at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
